in other directions\\n      <br/>\\n      Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk\\n      <br/>\\n      Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection\\n      <br/>\\n      Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record\\n      <br/>\\n      But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up\\n      <br/>\\n      Was through that

fuck him then\\n      <br/>\\n      But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think\\n      <br/>\\n      That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.\\n      <br/>\\n      And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind\\n      <br/>\\n      We still have soldiers that's on the front line\\n      <br/>\\n      That's willing to die for us as soon as we give

    <br/>\\n      But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered\\n      <br/>\\n      It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it\\n      <br/>\\n      Then to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the verdict\\n      <br/>\\n      I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further\\n      <br/>\\n      But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm
