# What-We-Talkin-Bout

Lyrical analysis of rap music in America

Artists divided into 4 regions (West Coast, East Coast, Mid West, Down South)

Top 25 artists chosen per region via Ranker.com

Relevance trend calculated by plotting streaming platform popularity over Google Trends data

Mid West seems to be the most popular - let's find out why!

Chose top 3 artists per region for song lyrical analysis.

WebScraped AZ-Lyrics.com for lyrics information to hopefully find topical trends and subject matter

Trends that became apparent were the popularity of the word "I'm" (talking about self) and frequency of curse words (bad boys).

Plotted mean of each metric per song against each other (3440 songs analyzed)

Mid West had least amount of cursing and average amount of "I'm" frequency

Decided to bootstrap for better sampling info

Took 4 random tracks from the top 25 artists per region

Bootstrapped sample data 1000 times to determine more confident mean values

That's all folks.
