I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure\n      <br/>\n      Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders\n      <br/>\n      I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it\n      <br/>\n      Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter\n      <br/>\n      I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to\n      <br/>\n      I'm supposed to set an example\n      <br/>\n      I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em\n      <br/>\n      If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em\n      <br/>\n      That Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it\n      <br/>\n      There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it\n      <br/>\n      I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it\n      <br/>\n      It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit\n      <br/>\n      And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it\n      <br/>\n      I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted\n      <br/>\n      And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it\n      <br/>\n      This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it\n      <br/>\n      That was never my object for someone to get killed\n      <br/>\n      Why would I wanna destroy something I help build\n      <br/>\n      It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good\n      <br/>\n      I went through my whole career without ever mentionin'\n      <br/>\n      And that was just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth\n      <br/>\n      And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about\n      <br/>\n      Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef\n      <br/>\n      So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth\n      <br/>\n      While he's all over t.v. down talkin' a man who literally saved my life\n      <br/>\n      Like fuck it i understand this is business\n      <br/>\n      And this shit just isn't none of my business\n      <br/>\n      But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cause\n      <br/>\n

<br/>\n      And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'\n      <br/>\n      But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it\n      <br/>\n      The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?\n      <br/>\n      It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'\n      <br/>\n      We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'\n      <br/>\n      Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him\n      <br/>\n      And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him\n      <br/>\n      Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him\n      <br/>\n      Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it\n      <br/>\n      Meanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions\n      <br/>\n      Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk\n      <br/>\n      Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection\n      <br/>\n      Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record\n      <br/>\n      But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up\n      <br/>\n      Was through that publication the same one that made me famous\n      <br/>\n      Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'\n      <br/>\n      Well fuck it, that motherfucker can get it too, fuck him then\n      <br/>\n      But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think\n      <br/>\n      That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.\n      <br/>\n      And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind\n      <br/>\n      We still have soldiers that's on the front line\n      <br/>\n      That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders\n      <br/>\n      Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us\n      <br/>\n      We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus\n      <br/>\n      To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is\n      <br/>\n      To have Runyan Avenue, soldiers up in our corners\n      <br/>\n      Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is\n      <br/>\n      But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered\n      <br/>\n      It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it\n      <br/>\n      Then to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the verdict\n      <br/>\n      I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further\n      <br/>\n      But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'\n      <br/>\n      I'm just willin' to be the bigger man\n      <br/>\n      If ya'll can quit poppin' off at the jaws, well then I can\n      <br/>\n      Cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'\n      <br/>\n      I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my
