fuck him then\\n      <br/>\\n      But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think\\n      <br/>\\n      That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.\\n      <br/>\\n      And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind\\n      <br/>\\n      We still have soldiers that's on the front line\\n      <br/>\\n      That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders\\n      <br/>\\n      Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us\\n      <br/>\\n      We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus\\n      <br/>\\n      To show them we

out of my mind dying\\n      <br/>\\n      There is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is\\n      <br/>\\n      Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges\\n      <br/>\\n      Why you even doing this to yourself, it's pointless\\n      <br/>\\n      Why do we have to keep on going through this, this is torturous\\n      <br/>\\n      My point is this\\n      <br/>\\n      That if you say mean things, your weenie will shrink\\n      <br/>\\n      Now I forgot what the chorus is, you're just a\\n      <br/>\\n      <br/>\\n      You are just jealous of me\\n
