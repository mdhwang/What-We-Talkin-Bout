while your mother is cooking the macaronni\n      <br/>\n      Today I figured id sit down and talk to you since your old enough\n      <br/>\n      You know its time that you really realize what this family is all about\n      <br/>\n      Cause about this time is when your gonna be able to join in\n      <br/>\n      And earn some real money and real cash but before you do that\n      <br/>\n      I wanna teach you a little bit about loyalty\n      <br/>\n      The main name of this game is respect and loyalty\n      <br/>\n      Family is a big thing when we do this kind of business\n      <br/>\n      Everything is with respect and when a family member gets outta\n      <br/>\n      Line and another family don't like it one thing leads to another\n      <br/>\n      And the next thing you know, your gone and then your just a memory of me\n      <br/>\n      My hearts broke then, but you gotta remember there's always family and loyalty\n      <br/>\n      Loyalty is the main thing. obviously you know I don't make my money\n      <br/>\n      I don't make all my cash from uh construction jobs we do and\n      <br/>\n      Uh sanitation and private stuff is all earned money through the family\n      <br/>\n      And since your of age now I think its time I\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      Taught you what coming into the family and respect is all about\n      <br/>\n      So the first thing you gotta learn is the name respect\n      <br/>\n      Tha means you don't cross nobody you don't go over the line\n      <br/>\n      Once you go over that line there's no coming back whether\n      <br/>\n      You're a member of the family or not\n      <br/>\n      That's when people get whacked and we don't want nobody whacked in our family\n      <br/>\n      So I gotta teach you the proper way of respect\n      <br/>\n      When you're earning money, everybody earns, everybody eats bread\n      <br/>\n      Its all about cash money that's what its all about making the money\n      <br/>\n      So the first thing of business is this, you remember your name\n      <br/>\n      You don't forgets your roots\n      <br/>\n      You never ever disrespect anyone that's above you especially your capo\n      <br/>\n      Especially the big time guys, those are the guys you listen to\n      <br/>\n      You never ever disrespect anyone unless your told to unless you get the okay\n      <br/>\n      And if there is no sit down there's nothing\n     </div>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n     "}, {"artist": "birdman", "track": "overherehustlin", "lyrics": "\n

for doing this shit again, and always doing this shit for his dawg. My nigga, one time. Thank everybody involved, everybody involved. My team, my team is my fam. Everybody who put they fingerprints on this shit, 'preciate everybody\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      So the definition of Dedication has changed for me since the first one, since the second one, since the third one, whatever. It's because, umm, whenever I put it out, umm, it's life. And since I don't write none of my shit, I'm coming from the head. And what happens is, when you rap so long or when you do it so long, all the things in your head, you done used up. So what happens is you gotta start using something else and coming from somewhere else, and that somewhere else is ten times out of ten your heart. And, umm, that's what this Dedication 6 project is\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      But, uh, yeah, the definition is always different because I'm always going through something at that time of my life, you know what I mean. I prolly was fucking your bitch on Dedication 4, and the whole fucking shit was dedicated to her, you know what I mean. I dunno. Whichever one that wasn't, that didn't do as well as all of the rest of them, that was definitely the one that was dedicated to her\n     </div>\n     <br/>\n     <br/>\n     "}, {"artist": "lilwayne", "track": "gobrazy", "lyrics": "\n      <i>\n       [DJ Drama:]\n      </i>\n      <br/>\n      Ride with mula\n      <br/>\n      Yeah that's the mob\n      <br/>\n      Come check with Dram\n      <br/>\n      And do ya job\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <i>\n       [Lil Wayne:]\n      </i>\n      <br/>\n      I'm not worthy of your controversy\n      <br/>\n      I'm not thirsty baby I'm allergic\n      <br/>\n      Colder than a hockey jersey\n      <br/>\n      Dirty like Kentucky Derby\n      <br/>\n      I was lying on a gurney\n      <br/>\n      I don't wanna die early\n      <br/>\n      I was screaming fuck the world\n      <br/>\n      You was singing like a bird, yeah\n      <br/>\n      Never be concerned or worried\n      <br/>\n      Two girls like Laverne and Shirley\n      <br/>\n      Wake up in the morning early\n      <br/>\n      Tell 'em that I love 'em dearly\n      <br/>\n      They say oh my God have mercy\n      <br/>\n      Shining like a I got on Jergens\n      <br/>\n      You can hear my diamonds screaming\n      <br/>\n      Like they just met God in person\n      <br/>\n      Oh my God the squad alerted, I confirm it\n      <br/>\n      They hop up like kermit\n      <br/>\n      Come to bless you like a sermon\n      <br/>\n      My house lit like Pee-Wee Herman's\n      <br/>\n      And you know I bought it furnished\n      <br/>\n      I'm determined like attorneys\n      <br/>\n      Ya'll lil boys ain't got attorneys\n      <br/>\n      I just hope she not a burden\n      <br/>\n      I just hope she got a purpose\n      <br/>\n      That first week was power surging\n      <br/>\n      Oh my God the socket working\n      <br/>\n      I been listening to the money, it been telling me it's coming\n      <br/>\n      Sound like music to my ears, like a symphony of hundreds\n      <br/>\n      Momma told me I'd be special, Grandma told me I'd be something\n      <br/>\n      I made sure they wasn't guessing\n      <br/>\n      Made the most out they assumptions\n      <br/>\n      Being everything but simple\n      <br/>\n      Stretch a dollar like a limo\n      <br/>\n      Got a grill in one dimple\n      <br/>\n      Got my deal without a demo\n      <br/>\n      Tunechi\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <i>\n       [Dj Drama:]\n      </i>\n      <br/>\n      Ride with Mula\n      <br/>\n      Yeah that's the mob\n      <br/>\n      Come check with Dram\n      <br/>\n      And do ya job\n      <br/>\n      Thanksgiving is the name\n      <br/>\n      IceBox did the chain\n      <br/>\n      Rolex for the watch\n      <br/>\n      Motherfucker, Plain Jane\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <i>\n       [Jay Jones:]\n      </i>\n      <br/>\n      I got issues, I got problems\n      <br/>\n      We got missiles in the chopper\n      <br/>\n      Got a hoe from the Bahamas\n      <br/>\n      Let me sword fight with her tonsils\n      <br/>\n      Brought the hoe up in the condo\n      <br/>\n      Had a party with Fernando\n      <br/>\n      I got condoms in the dresser\n      <br/>\n      Percosets on all the mantle\n      <br/>\n      All they handle\n      <br/>\n      Name a bitch that I ain't fuck and Imma bag her\n      <br/>\n      Keep it real, if I ain't fuck then my bros Tune and Mack done had her\n      <br/>\n      Got a bitch cook like a chef\n      <br/>\n      I had a hoe from out the\n      <i>\n       [?]\n      </i>\n      <br/>\n      She like to suck dick with no hands\n      <br/>\n      She say she do shit with no help\n      <br/>\n      Control myself\n      <br/>\n      I been working overtime I owe myself\n      <br/>\n      I like my bitches thick and quick to go and lick below the belt\n      <br/>\n      I brought a goat to Hollygrove\n      <br/>\n      Flew your hoe out to my shows\n      <br/>\n      What happen on these tour buses?

So that's why I still jump my ass in these motherfuckin' booths, wherever I can find a booth, most likely the same one, and do my motherfuckin' thing. And I gotta keep doing my thing and that's why I do my thing because the culture say it's important. They say \"We want that, we need that, we gotta have that.\" It make the-it make the world know what I mean?

You know what I mean I don't even consider that damn shit not an album just a mixtape, you know what I mean, but to him that was real, that shit was real, could be a project not an album, so shout out to homie.
